## A Chain of Blocks

> A wanna-be blockchain built in Java.

 With my growing interest in the cryptocurrency space and the bitcoin protocol, I decided to take it upon myself to understand the inner workings of a blockchain. Using tutorials scavenged on the internets, my academic knowledge of cryptography, and the Bitcoin Whitepaper itself, I was able to build a simplified local blockchain that utilizes the proof-of-work (PoW) system.

 Once upon a time, I was a hardcore gamer. My budding interest in Computer Science naturally led me down the path of learning Unity 3D, designing simple games, and eventually trying to teach others to do the same.
