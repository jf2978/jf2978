 I'm helping build APM Map in hopes to simplify and humanize the recruiting process â€” sharing the tools we all need and creating a supportive community to bring our best selves to that interview.

## A Chain of Blocks

> A wanna-be blockchain built in Java.

 With my growing interest in the cryptocurrency space and the bitcoin protocol, I decided to take it upon myself to understand the inner workings of a blockchain. Using tutorials scavenged on the internets, my academic knowledge of cryptography, and the Bitcoin Whitepaper itself, I was able to build a simplified local blockchain that utilizes the proof-of-work (PoW) system.

## Java Netcat

> A command-line application that emulates the well-known networking tool, [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat).

 Having been in awe during a lecture that demonstrated `nc` -- what felt like to me as the original instant messaging tool -- I thought it'd be a cool exercise to try to recreate it with my working knowledge of sockets. I dove into the project with more questions than answers, but took a bunch of [notes](https://github.com/jf2978/Java-Netcat/blob/master/sockets.notes) and learned a ton.

## Flappy Bird: CU GameDev Edition

> Stuff about flappy bird goes here ...


<details>
<br> 
  
 Once upon a time, I was a hardcore gamer. My budding interest in Computer Science naturally led me down the path of learning Unity 3D, designing simple games, and eventually trying to teach others to do the same.
